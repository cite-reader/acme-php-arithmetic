I recently came across an interesting technique for embedding dynamic languages
in static ones. Naturally, I had to try it. The intent was to prove a point to
people who claim that you "need dynamic typing" for some things; but about
halfway through it turned into a rant about how dumb PHP's semantics are.

Half blog post, half library, two hundred percent bad idea.
